How do I want to improve my API for version 2?

    1. nested resources for language, city/county, district(need more models?)
        like: api/v1/{language}/{city/county}/{id}

        Can have urls like: 
            - api/v2 -> get all vet clinics in Chinese and English
            - api/v2/en -> get all vet clinics in English
            - api/v2/zh -> get all vet clinics in Chinese
            - api/v2/{language}/{id} -> get single vet clinic
            - api/v2/{language}/{city/county}/{id}
        
        Models: 
            1. VetClinicsEN -> store English info
            2. VetClinicsZH -> store Chinese info

    2. deploy version 1 on server, so JS frontend can interact with my API(not sure how to do it, can it be free?)
